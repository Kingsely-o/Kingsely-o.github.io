I am a PhD Research Student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore, specializing in traffic safety analysis under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Feng. My research focuses on applying advanced machine learning techniques to understand and improve transportation systems, with particular emphasis on mixed traffic flow analysis and safety optimization.

## Current Research Focus

My primary research involves developing innovative frameworks for extracting and analyzing mixed traffic flow trajectories using enhanced computer vision techniques. I work with UAV and CCTV data to create comprehensive traffic analysis systems that can accurately track and predict vehicle behaviors in complex urban environments.

## Research Areas & Achievements

### Traffic Safety & Transportation Systems
- **Enhanced AT-YOLOv8 Framework**: Developed a cutting-edge framework merging MHA-YOLOv8 with Coordinate Attention for enhanced detection and Improved DeepSORT for accurate tracking, achieving an unparalleled 98.5% accuracy in trajectory extraction from UAV footage.
- **TrafficSense Project**: Launched in Hong Kong, securing $100,000 funding from HKSTP for advanced traffic analysis solutions.
- **Smartflow Project**: Currently developing at NTU with SDG$5,000 funding support.

### Machine Learning & Environmental Engineering
- **Autoencoder Ensemble Stacking (AES) Model**: Pioneered advanced predictions of microbial extracellular electron transfer activities in paddy soils.
- **Environmental Analytics**: Applied Artificial Neural Networks to identify key physicochemical properties influencing redox activities in humic substances.
- **5+ SCI Publications**: Published in top-tier journals including Environmental Research (JCR Q1), Science China Technological Sciences (JCR Q1), and Neurocomputing (JCR Q1).

### Edge AI & Optimization
- **LLMs for Edge AIPC**: Leading projects to optimize Large Language Models for edge computing deployment in educational settings.
- **QLoRA & PEFT Implementation**: Utilizing advanced quantization techniques for efficient AI model deployment across varied environments.
