This collaborative epidemiological research investigates how climate change and demographic shifts may influence the health benefits typically associated with air quality improvements. The study focuses on cardiovascular mortality patterns in Guangzhou, providing crucial insights for urban health planning.

**Research Focus:**
- Interaction effects between climate change and air quality on health outcomes
- Population aging considerations in environmental health assessment
- Cardiovascular mortality patterns in urban environments
- Policy implications for environmental and public health strategies

**Scientific Contribution:**
The research contributes to understanding complex environmental-health relationships in rapidly changing urban environments, informing evidence-based policy development for sustainable urban planning and health protection strategies.
