As co-author of this significant research, I contributed to developing machine learning models for predicting heavy metal bioaccessibility across continental China. This work addresses critical environmental health concerns related to soil contamination and exposure assessment.

**Research Contributions:**
- Advanced machine learning model development for heavy metal prediction
- Continental-scale environmental criteria determination
- Focus on critical heavy metals: Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), and Arsenic (As)
- Integration of large-scale soil property datasets

**Environmental Impact:**
This research directly supports environmental protection policies and soil quality standards in China, providing tools for risk assessment and public health protection from heavy metal exposure.
