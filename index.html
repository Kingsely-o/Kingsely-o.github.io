<h1>Welcome to Jiajun Ou's Academic Website</h1>

I am a PhD Research Student at Nanyang Technological University (NTU) Singapore, specializing in traffic safety analysis under the supervision of Prof. Zhu Feng. My research focuses on applying advanced machine learning techniques to understand and improve transportation systems, with particular emphasis on mixed traffic flow analysis and safety optimization.

<h2>Current Research Focus</h2>

My primary research involves developing innovative frameworks for extracting and analyzing mixed traffic flow trajectories using enhanced computer vision techniques. I work with UAV and CCTV data to create comprehensive traffic analysis systems that can accurately track and predict vehicle behaviors in complex urban environments.
